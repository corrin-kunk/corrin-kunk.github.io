	<h1>CSS Measuring Units</h1>

	<p><b>Length</b> in CSS can be definied as a number followed by a length unit. For example, <code>10px</code> or
		<code>2em</code>.
	</p>

	<p>There are two different types of lengths: <b>absolute</b> and <b>relative</b>.
		Absolute units are meant to be fixed measurements, while relative units change depending on things like font
		size or viewport size</p>

	<h2>Absolute Lengths</h2>
	<p>Absolute length units are most commonly used when you want consistent sizing that does not depend on screen size
		or user settingfs. They are especially useful for print layouts or small design details that should stay the
		same everywhere.</p>
	<p>The most common absolute units you'll see in CSS include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><code>cm</code> - centimeters</li>
		<li><code>mm</code> - millimeters</li>
		<li><code>in</code> - inches (1in = 2.54cm)</li>
		<li><code>px</code> - pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in)</li>
		<li><code>pt</code> - points (1pt = 1/72th of 1in)</li>
		<li><code>pc</code> - picas (1pc = 12pt)</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Relative Lengths</h2>
	<p>Relative length units are based on another measurement, such as the font size of an element or the size of the
		browser window.
		Because they can scale and adjust, they are commonly responsive web design and help layouts adapt to different
		devices and user settings.</p>
	<p>Some common relative units include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><code>em</code> - relative to the font-size of the element</li>
		<li><code>ex</code> - relative to the x-height of the current font (rarely used)</li>
		<li><code>ch</code> - relative to the width of the "0" (zero) character in the current font</li>
		<li><code>rem</code> - relative to the font-size of the root element (html)</li>
		<li><code>vw</code> - relative to 1% of the width of the viewport</li>
		<li><code>vh</code> - relative to 1% of the height of the viewport</li>
		<li><code>vmin</code> - relative to 1% of the viewport's smaller dimension</li>
		<li><code>vmax</code> - relative to 1% of the viewport's larger dimension</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>What is <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code>?</h3>
	<p><code>em</code> is a relative unit that is based on the font-size of the element it is used on.
		For example, if an element has a font-size of 16px, then 1em would be equal to 16px.
		If you set the font-size of an element to 2em, it would be 32px (2 times the font-size of the element).</p>
	<p><code>rem</code> is similar to <code>em</code>, but it is relative to the font-size of the root element (html)
		instead of the current element.
		This means that if the root element has a font-size of 16px, then 1rem would always be equal to 16px, regardless
		of the font-size of the current element.</p>

	<h3>What is <code>vw</code> and <code>vh</code>?</h3>
	<p><code>vw</code> and <code>vh</code> are relative units that are based on the size of the viewport.
		<code>vw</code> is relative to the width of the viewport, while <code>vh</code> is relative to the height of the
		viewport.
		For example, if the viewport is 1000px wide, then 1vw would be equal to 10px (1% of 1000px).
		If the viewport is 800px tall, then 1vh would be equal to 8px (1% of 800px).
	</p>

	<h3>What is <code>vmax</code> and <code>vmin</code>?</h3>
	<p><code>vmax</code> and <code>vmin</code> are relative units that are based on the size of the viewport.
		<code>vmax</code> is relative to the larger dimension of the viewport, while <code>vmin</code> is relative to
		the smaller dimension of the viewport.
		For example, if the viewport is 1000px wide and 800px tall, then 1vmax would be equal to 10px (1% of 1000px) and
		1vmin would be equal to 8px (1% of 800px).
